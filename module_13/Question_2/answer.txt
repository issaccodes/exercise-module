Q. Explain the role of the following key properties in the flexbox layout model.

1. justify-content
2. align-items
3. gap
4. flex-direction
5. flex-wrapo

-> 

1. justify-content:

    Role: Aligns flex items along the main axis (horizontal by default, unless flex-direction is changed).
    
    Common Values:

    -flex-start (default): Items align at the start of the main axis.
    -flex-end: Items align at the end of the main axis.
    -center: Items are centered along the main axis.
    -space-between: Equal spacing between items; no space at the container's edges.
    -space-around: Equal spacing around items; half-space at edges.
    -space-evenly: Equal spacing between items and at the edges.

2. align-items:

    Role: Aligns flex items along the cross axis (vertical by default, unless flex-direction is changed).
    
    Common Values:

    -stretch (default): Items stretch to fill the container along the cross axis.
    -flex-start: Items align at the start of the cross axis.
    -flex-end: Items align at the end of the cross axis.
    -center: Items are centered along the cross axis.
    -baseline: Items align along their text baseline.

3. gap:

    Role: Sets spacing between flex items along both the main and cross axes.

    Key Feature: Simplifies spacing without adding margins.
    
    Common Values:

    CSS length units, e.g., 10px, 1rem, 5%.

4. flex-direction:

    Role: Defines the direction of flex items within the container.

    Common Values:

    -row (default): Items are laid out horizontally from left to right.
    -row-reverse: Items are laid out horizontally from right to left.
    -column: Items are laid out vertically from top to bottom.

5. flex-wrap:

    Role: Determines whether flex items wrap onto multiple lines when they run out of space in the container.

    Common Values:

    -nowrap (default): All items remain on one line, even if they overflow.
    -wrap: Items wrap onto multiple lines when necessary.
    -wrap-reverse: Items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order.
